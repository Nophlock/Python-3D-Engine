[Disclaimer]
This is a small personal project to get back in some OpenGL-Development without the hassle to compile anything in C++ or anything else. It's small side project which can load IQM-Files and display the animations by coding everything in Python directly. It probably doesnt have a use case as a real Engine since python is to slow for all the heavy math calculations (maybe if you use Numpy instead of own classes). But anyway might be usefull for someone who wants to understand the IQM-3D-File or for anything else. Beside that I will probably update the code from time to time, if i want to expand it. Note that it isn't commented at all since it's only for me hobby-wise but I though that it could be usefull for someone and I want to use git to keep track of my progress :P



[Libraries]
Numpy (I use it at for some testing, maybe it's still at some places in the code :P)
ctypes
Pyglet
Python 3.91


[RUN]
Just type in "python engine.py" and everything should work hopefully ...
